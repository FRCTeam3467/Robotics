WingMan
=======

The following project contains the code necessary to build Wingman, team 3467's 2013 robot.

In order to build and deploy code:
1. Install eclipse on your development machine
   If this is not already installed, download "Eclipse IDE for Java" from:
      https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

2. Launch eclipse

3. From eclipse, install eGit
   eGit is an eclipse plugin that allows you to access the GIT repository where team 3467 code is stored.
   To install eGit, navigate to the Help Menu (top of screen), then select "Eclipse MarketPlace" from the menu.
   In the "Find" textbox, type "eGit", then click on the magnifier to search for the eGit installer.
   After some time, eclipse should present you with a list. Select "eGit - Egit Team Provider" from the list and 
   select the "install" button for this.
   (If the "install" button is not present, eGit is already installed and you can skip this step)
